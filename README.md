# CS210

#Summarize the project and what problem it was asking to solve.
this project asked for the developer(me) toa create a item tracking program for the corner grocer..
and to produce a list of items sold with each items quantity. along with a histogram.


#What did you do particular well? where could you have improved your code?
I feel very confident in making the user menu and the options given for each output.. 
where i could have improved my code could have been my layout i dont feel that i needed to oraganize or make my code 
any better but theres always room for improvement.


#What piece of the code did you find particularly challenging? what tools did you use to overcome this problem?
My issue wasn't neccesarily writing the code my main isssue was having the right files in the correct paths 
since this project was Python and C++ integrated i had to go back and fourth between lines of code and files so i 
made sure i checked all the correct case sensitive words and having made sure the files were correctly named.


#What skills from this project will be transferable to other future projects? How did you make this project maintainable,readable,and adaptable?
the skill that has stuck with me the most was learning how to integrate to languages together i didn't have a hard time in the beginning so i hope using this
new skill will greatly help me in the future with making projects that have to use more than two different languages.
To make my code maintable and readable i made sure to make my user menu as simple to read so that the user would know what  options were available
along with what the numerical choices meant. along with a good for loop to allow the user to keep choosing from the menu options if needed.
